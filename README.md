This cheatsheet is a helpful tool for frontend development, which I've started to work on around beggining of the Covid 19.

For now it contains examples of UI, whole components and guidlines for following topics:

* Log in and Sign up form
* React state and props
* React router
* To do list
* Clock
* Countdown using a MomentJS library
* Tip calculator

There is more planned in the future.

I'd like to add some not so common CSS styling tips, more Javascript like guidlines and examples of some functions, definitely React hooks, Redux guidline and some new features of ECMAScript from ES6 (2015) till currently newest 11th edition of ECMSScript from June 2020.
