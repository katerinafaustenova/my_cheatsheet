      <h1>State and Props</h1>
      <h2>Explanation and usage</h2>
      <p>
        React state is an object that represents the parts of the app that can
        change.
      </p>
      <p>
        State is needed when we want our app to do something and to keep track
        of it (interact like add or delete stuff, log in or log out from a user
        acount and know when the user is logged in or not).
      </p>
      <p>
        Each component can maintain its own state in an object called this.state
        in a key/value pairs.
      </p>
      <p>Only class component can use state as an example below !</p>
      <p>
        For changing the current state we need to explicitly said that to React,
        and we do that by calling this.setState method inside a component.
      </p>
      <p>
        When changing the state, React will automatically re-render every time
        we call setState method.
      </p>
      <p>
        Very important is NOT to change this.state directly. Use this.setState.
      </p>
      <p>
        State changes are asynchronous. If we read from this.state immediately
        after calling this.setState, it probably wonâ€™t reflect the changes yet.
      </p>

      <p>
        React props (properties) allow us to pass some data from one component
        to another.
      </p>
      <p>
        Props can be passed only one way - from top to bottom, which means from
        parent to its children.
      </p>
      <p>
        Important information is that props are read-only. So the data coming
        from a parent should NOT be changed by its children.
      </p>
      <p>
        To pass data, first we need to set attribute and its value. Then we can
        use props keyword to pass it to its children as shown below with the Box
        component.
