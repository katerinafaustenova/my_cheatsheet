        <h1>State and Props</h1>
        <h2>Explanation and usage</h2>
        <p>
          React state is an object that represents the parts of the app that can
          change.
        </p>
        <p>
          State is needed when we want our app to do anything (interact like add
          or delete stuff, log in or log out from a user acount).
        </p>
        <p>
          Each component can maintain its own state in an object called
          this.state in a key/value pairs.
        </p>
        <p>Only class component can use state as an example below !</p>
        <p>
          For changing the current state we need to explicitly said that to
          React, and we do that by calling this.setState method inside a
          component.
        </p>
        <p>
          When changing the state, React will automatically re-render every time
          we call setState method.
        </p>
        <p>
          Very important is NOT to change this.state directly. Use
          this.setState.
        </p>
        <p>
          State changes are asynchronous. If we read from this.state immediately
          after calling this.setState, it probably wonâ€™t reflect the changes
          yet.
        </p>

        <p>
          React props (properties) allow us to pass some data from one component
          to another.
        </p>
        <p>
          Props can be passed only one way - from top to bottom, which means
          from parent to its children.
        </p>
        <p>
          Important information is that props are read-only. So the data coming
          from a parent should NOT be changed by its children.
        </p>
        <p>
          To pass data, first we need to set attribute and its value. Then we
          can use props keyword to pass it to its children as shown below with
          the Box component.
        </p>
